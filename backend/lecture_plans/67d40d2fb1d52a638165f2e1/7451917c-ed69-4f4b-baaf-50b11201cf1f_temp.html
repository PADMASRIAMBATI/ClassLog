<p><strong>Course:</strong> Mathematics/Finance</p>
<p><strong>Chapter:</strong> Interest</p>
<p><strong>Lecture Title:</strong> Understanding Simple and Compound Interest</p>
<p><strong>1. Topics &amp; Subtopics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I. Simple Interest (60 minutes)</strong><ul>
<li>A. Definition of Simple Interest</li>
<li>B. Formula for Simple Interest:  <code>I = P * r * t</code>  (Explanation of each variable: Principal (P), Rate (r), Time (t))</li>
<li>C. Calculating Simple Interest: Worked examples with varying time periods (years, months, days).</li>
<li>D. Finding Principal, Rate, or Time given the other variables.  (Solving for P, r, or t)</li>
<li>E. Applications of Simple Interest:  Loans, investments with simple interest calculations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>II. Compound Interest (75 minutes)</strong><ul>
<li>A. Definition of Compound Interest and the concept of compounding.</li>
<li>B. Formula for Compound Interest: <code>A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)</code> (Explanation of each variable:  Principal (P), Rate (r), Time (t), Number of times interest is compounded per year (n)).</li>
<li>C. Calculating Compound Interest: Worked examples with different compounding periods (annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly).</li>
<li>D. Comparing Simple and Compound Interest:  Illustrating the differences through examples and graphs.</li>
<li>E. Future Value and Present Value: Introducing the concepts and showing calculations.</li>
<li>F.  Applications of Compound Interest: Savings accounts, investments, mortgages (brief overview).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Materials Needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whiteboard or Projector</li>
<li>Markers or Pens</li>
<li>Handout with formulas and key definitions (provided)</li>
<li>Calculator (students should bring their own)</li>
<li>Slides (PowerPoint or similar) with examples and visuals (provided) – including graphs comparing simple and compound interest.</li>
<li>Optional: Spreadsheet software (Excel or Google Sheets) for demonstrating calculations and visualizing growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>Upon completion of this lecture, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define simple and compound interest.</li>
<li>Calculate simple interest using the appropriate formula.</li>
<li>Calculate compound interest using the appropriate formula for various compounding periods.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast simple and compound interest.</li>
<li>Apply these concepts to solve real-world problems related to loans and investments.</li>
<li>Understand the concepts of future value and present value (in the context of compound interest).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Timeline Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(0-15 mins):</strong> Introduction – Review of basic percentage calculations.  Introduce the concept of interest and its importance.</li>
<li><strong>(15-45 mins):</strong> Simple Interest – Cover subtopics A-E. Include several worked examples and allow time for student questions.</li>
<li><strong>(45-50 mins):</strong>  Short break/Q&amp;A addressing any lingering questions on simple interest.</li>
<li><strong>(50-75 mins):</strong> Compound Interest – Cover subtopics A-D. Use visuals to emphasize the difference between simple and compound interest growth.</li>
<li><strong>(75-90 mins):</strong> Compound Interest (continued) – Cover subtopics E &amp; F. Introduce Future and Present Value concepts briefly.</li>
<li><strong>(90-105 mins):</strong> Q&amp;A and wrap-up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Exercises &amp; Homework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-class Activity (30 mins):</strong>  Students work in pairs to solve a series of simple and compound interest problems.</li>
<li><strong>Homework:</strong><ul>
<li>Solve 5 simple interest problems (varying difficulty).</li>
<li>Solve 5 compound interest problems (varying compounding periods and difficulty).</li>
<li>A comparison question:  Calculate and compare the total interest earned on $1000 invested for 5 years at 5% interest, compounded annually vs. simple interest.</li>
<li>(Optional) Research and present a real-world example of simple or compound interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Additional Resources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Khan Academy videos on simple and compound interest.</li>
<li>Investopedia articles on interest calculations.</li>
<li>Online interest calculators (various websites available).</li>
<li>Textbook examples and practice problems (refer to specific textbook used).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This lecture plan is designed for a 105-minute lecture.  Adjust timings as needed based on student engagement and pace.  The optional spreadsheet software can be used for more complex problems or demonstrating large-scale investment growth over extended periods, if time permits.</p>
