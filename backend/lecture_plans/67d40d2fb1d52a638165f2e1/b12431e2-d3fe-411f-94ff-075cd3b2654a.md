**Chapter:** Interest

**Topic:** Compound Interest

**1. Topics & Subtopics:**

* **I. Introduction to Interest:**
    * Definition of Interest
    * Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest (brief comparison)
    * Importance of Understanding Compound Interest in Finance
* **II. Understanding Compound Interest:**
    * The concept of compounding (periodic interest added to principal)
    * Identifying the key variables: Principal (P), Rate (r), Time (t), Number of compounding periods (n)
    * Formula for Compound Interest:  A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
    * Explanation of each variable in the formula
* **III. Calculating Compound Interest:**
    * Worked examples demonstrating the calculation of future value (A)
    * Examples with varying compounding periods (annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily)
    * Application of the formula to different scenarios (e.g., savings accounts, investments)
* **IV.  Effect of Compounding Frequency:**
    * Comparison of different compounding frequencies and their impact on future value.
    * Illustrating the power of compounding over time through examples and graphs.
* **V.  Continuous Compounding:**
    * Introduction to the concept of continuous compounding
    * Formula for continuous compounding: A = Pe^(rt)
    * Examples and applications of continuous compounding.
* **VI. Applications of Compound Interest:**
    *  Real-world examples: Retirement planning, loan calculations, investment growth
    *  Understanding the time value of money in context with compound interest.


**2. Materials Needed:**

* Whiteboard or projector
* Markers or pens
* Slides (PowerPoint or similar) with formulas, graphs, and examples.  Include visuals to illustrate the growth of money over time.
* Scientific calculator (students should bring their own or access to online calculators)
* Spreadsheet software (Excel or Google Sheets) â€“ optional for demonstrating calculations and creating graphs.


**3. Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Define compound interest and differentiate it from simple interest.
* Identify and explain the key variables used in compound interest calculations.
* Apply the compound interest formula to calculate future value in various scenarios.
* Compare the impact of different compounding frequencies on investment growth.
* Understand the concept of continuous compounding and its formula.
* Apply the knowledge of compound interest to real-world financial situations.
