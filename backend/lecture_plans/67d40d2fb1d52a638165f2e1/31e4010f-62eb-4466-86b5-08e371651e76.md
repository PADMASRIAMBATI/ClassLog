# Lecture Plan: Simple and Compound Interest

**Course:** Mathematics/Finance (adjust as needed)

**Chapter:** Interest

**Lecture Title:** Understanding Simple and Compound Interest

**1. Topics & Subtopics:**

* **I. Simple Interest:**
    * Definition and Formula:  Principal (P), Rate (R), Time (T), and Interest (I).
    * Calculating Simple Interest:  Numerical examples and step-by-step solutions.
    * Applications of Simple Interest:  Loans, savings accounts (basic scenarios).
    * Finding Principal, Rate, or Time: Solving for unknowns in the simple interest formula.
* **II. Compound Interest:**
    * Definition and Concept:  Understanding the power of compounding.
    * The Compound Interest Formula:  A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) â€“ explaining each variable (n = compounding periods per year).
    * Calculating Compound Interest:  Examples with different compounding frequencies (annual, semi-annual, quarterly).
    * Comparing Simple and Compound Interest:  Illustrating the difference in growth over time.
    * Applications of Compound Interest:  Investments, mortgages (basic scenarios).
    * Future Value and Present Value:  Introduction to these key financial concepts (brief overview).


**2. Materials Needed:**

* Whiteboard or projector
* Markers or pens
* Slides (PowerPoint or similar) with formulas, examples, and diagrams.  These should include visual representations of compound interest growth.
* Calculator (students should bring their own)
* Possibly financial calculator (optional, for demonstration purposes)
* Textbook (if applicable)


**3. Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Define simple and compound interest.
* Apply the formulas for simple and compound interest to solve problems.
* Differentiate between simple and compound interest and explain the impact of compounding.
* Solve for unknown variables (P, R, T) in simple interest problems.
* Calculate compound interest with varying compounding frequencies.
* Understand the basic concepts of future value and present value.
* Apply these concepts to simple real-world financial scenarios.

**5. Exercises & Homework:**

* **In-class exercise:**  Solve 2-3 simple interest problems with varying unknowns.
* **Homework:**
    * 5 simple interest problems (with varying difficulty)
    * 5 compound interest problems (with varying compounding frequencies)
    * 2 comparative problems (comparing simple vs. compound interest over different time periods)


**6. Additional Resources:**

* **Khan Academy:**  Search for "simple interest" and "compound interest" for video tutorials and practice problems.
* **Investopedia:**  Excellent resource for definitions and explanations of financial terms.
* **Online Calculators:** Several websites offer simple and compound interest calculators, useful for checking answers.  (Caution students to use these for verification, not as a replacement for understanding the formulas.)


**Note:** This lecture plan is a suggestion and can be adjusted based on the students' prior knowledge and the pace of the class.  Consider incorporating interactive elements, such as group work or quizzes, to enhance engagement.  The timeline is an estimate and may require adjustments depending on class participation and questions.
