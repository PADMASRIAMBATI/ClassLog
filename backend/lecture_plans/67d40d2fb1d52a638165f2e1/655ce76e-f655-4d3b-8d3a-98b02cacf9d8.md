# Lecture Plan: Simple and Compound Interest

**Course:** Mathematics/Finance

**Chapter:** Interest

**Lecture Title:** Understanding Simple and Compound Interest

**1. Topics & Subtopics:**

* **I. Simple Interest:**
    * A. Definition and Formula: Principal, Rate, Time, and Interest Calculation.
    * B. Applications of Simple Interest: Loans, Savings Accounts (basic scenarios).
    * C. Calculating Principal, Rate, or Time given the other variables.
    * D.  Simple Interest Applications involving Partial Periods.

* **II. Compound Interest:**
    * A. Definition and the Concept of Compounding:  Understanding how interest earns interest.
    * B. The Compound Interest Formula:  Deriving and applying the formula.
    * C.  Calculating Future Value (FV) and Present Value (PV).
    * D.  Effect of Compounding Frequency: Annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily.
    * E. Comparing Simple and Compound Interest: Demonstrating the difference over time.
    * F.  Advanced Applications:  Investment growth, loan amortization (basic introduction).

**2. Materials Needed:**

* Whiteboard or projector
* Markers or pens
* Handout with formulas and examples (provided below)
* Calculator (scientific recommended)
* Slides (PowerPoint or similar) with key formulas, examples, and visuals.  (Optional: pre-prepared slides showing step-by-step solutions to sample problems)
* Spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) â€“ Optional, for demonstrating larger calculations and visual representations.


**3. Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Define simple and compound interest.
* Apply the formulas for calculating simple and compound interest.
* Distinguish between simple and compound interest and understand the implications.
* Solve problems involving simple and compound interest calculations, including finding principal, rate, time, future value, and present value.
* Understand the impact of compounding frequency.
* Apply their knowledge to basic real-world scenarios.


**4. Timeline Breakdown (50-minute lecture):**

* **(5 minutes) Introduction:** Overview of the lecture, review of prerequisite knowledge (basic percentage calculations).
* **(15 minutes) Simple Interest:** Definition, formula, examples, and solving for different variables.  Incorporate a simple in-class problem.
* **(20 minutes) Compound Interest:** Definition, formula, examples,  impact of compounding frequency.  Compare to simple interest using a visual example. Include a slightly more challenging in-class problem.
* **(10 minutes)  Q&A and Summary:** Review key concepts, answer student questions, and highlight the importance of understanding these concepts in personal finance.

**5. Exercises & Homework:**

* **In-class Activities:** Two problems, one simple interest, one compound interest, solved collaboratively.
* **Homework:**
    * 5 simple interest problems (varying levels of difficulty).
    * 5 compound interest problems (varying levels of difficulty, including different compounding frequencies).
    * 2 comparison problems: comparing simple vs. compound interest over different time periods.


**6. Additional Resources:**

* **Khan Academy:** Search for "simple interest" and "compound interest" for video tutorials and practice exercises.
* **Investopedia:** Articles and explanations on simple and compound interest.
* **Online Calculators:** Numerous websites offer simple and compound interest calculators for verifying answers and exploring different scenarios.


**Handout Example (Formulas):**

* **Simple Interest:**
    * I = P * r * t
    * Where:
        * I = Interest earned
        * P = Principal (initial amount)
        * r = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
        * t = Time (in years)

* **Compound Interest:**
    * A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)
    * Where:
        * A = Future value of the investment/loan, including interest
        * P = Principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
        * r = Annual interest rate (decimal)
        * n = Number of times that interest is compounded per year
        * t = Number of years the money is invested or borrowed for


This lecture plan provides a solid framework. The specific examples and problem difficulty can be adjusted based on the students' level and the available time.  Remember to incorporate interactive elements and real-world applications to keep the students engaged.
